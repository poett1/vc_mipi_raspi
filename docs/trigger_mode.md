# Trigger Modes
Activate a trigger mode by
``` shell
v4l2-ctl -d <SUBDEV> -c  trigger_mode=<trigger mode number>
```
The trigger mode remains set until it is deactivated with 
``` shell
v4l2-ctl -d <SUBDEV> -c trigger_mode=0
```
`trigger_mode` is a V4L2 menu control, so only the trigger modes the connected sensor model actually supports (see the table below) are listed by
``` shell
v4l2-ctl -d <SUBDEV> -L    # or --list-ctrls-menus
```
Setting an unsupported mode number is still rejected with `-EINVAL`, whether or not it appears in the menu.

Following you will find timing diagrams to illustrate the specific behavior of each mode.
## External and pulse width trigger mode (1 or 2)
![External trigger mode](../docs/plantuml/tm_external.svg)

## Self trigger mode (3)
This feature uses the retrigger period register (reg13-16) to emulate a self-triggered mode that looks like the native streaming mode but with nanosecond accurate shutter speed setting and flash trigger output. The external trigger hardware signal is disabled in this mode. 

Be aware that the maximum framerate depends on the readout time of the sensor PLUS the shutter time in this mode (in contrast to the streaming mode where it is possible to expose the sensor PARALLEL to readout)

![Self trigger mode](../docs/plantuml/tm_self.svg)

## Single trigger mode (4)
Trigger the image acquisition by executing 
``` shell
v4l2-ctl -d <SUBDEV> -c single_trigger=1
```

## Self and sync trigger mode (3 and 5)
This mode is used to synchronise two or more sensor modules using a master/slave synchronisation.

Be aware of that you have to enable the flash output of the master sensor. Connect flash output of the master to trigger input of the slave sensor modules.

## Support for trigger modes
In the table below you can find, which camera supports which trigger mode.
